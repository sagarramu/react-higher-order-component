# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Higher-order components or HOC is the advanced method of reusing the component functionality logic. It simply takes the original component and returns the enhanced component.

Syntax:

const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(OriginalComponent);


## Reason to use Higher-Order component:

1 Easy to handle
2 Get rid of copying the same logic in every component
3 Makes code more readable
